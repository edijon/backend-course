"""
This module defines repository variables for different entities in the backend course application.

The repository variables are placeholders for the actual repository instances that will be used to
interact with the database or data source for the respective entities. These entities include:
- Promotions
- Plannings
- Teachers
- Courses
- Rooms

Initially, these repository variables are set to None and are expected to be assigned with the
appropriate repository instances during the application setup or initialization process.
